### What I learned

Ok, the background of this one was really tricky. I didn't know I could use multiple background images at the same time, but position it at the right place was the hardest part. I found out that I was using the correct property, background-position, but the wrong unity. I tried with percentages but the images did not remain in the correct place. 

So, after hours of suffering and pain the properly way to solve this was using viewport unities.
